| Keybind            | Description               |
|--------------------+---------------------------|
| =C-c f v=          | Fold region               |
| =C-c f a v=        | Refold all regions        |
| =C-c u v= or =C `= | Unfold region             |
| =C-c u a v=        | Unfold all regions        |
| =C-c d v=          | Delete folded region      |
| =C-c d a v=        | Delete all folded regions |

* TODO Configuration

* Troubleshooting
Sometimes an unfolded region does not fold back with =C-c f v=. To bypass this bug you must delete the folded region (=C-c d v=) and then fold it(=C-c f v=) again.
