* C/C++/Obj-C

I use C/C++ mostly for developing games. To that end, this module leverages the
[[https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode][irony plugin]] for auto-completion, eldoc documentation and syntax checking (with
flycheck).

Though it provides Objective-C support, I don't use it except to inspect
generated glue code for iOS mobile apps.

+ Snippets ([[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-snippets/tree/master/c-mode][c-mode]], [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-snippets/tree/master/c++-mode][c++-mode]])
+ File templates ([[../../feature/file-templates/templates/c-mode][c-mode]], [[../../feature/file-templates/templates/c++-mode][c++-mode]])

** Installation
~irony-server~ is required to use irony-mode's features auto-completion (among
other things). To install it, run ~M-x irony-install-server~.

This is all you need on Linux.

*** MacOS
libclang is required to build irony-server. On MacOS, the best way I know of to
get it is:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle (if (doom-system-os 'macos) "yes")
brew install llvm  # may take a while!
#+END_SRC
