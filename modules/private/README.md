# Private modules

Modules here are ignored by git and should contain personal settings you don't
want DOOM updates to interfere with (if that matters to you).

I include mine as a reference. However, keep in mind that it is fiercely
evil-mode-oriented. I apologize to non-evil users, but you will likely want to
rewrite +bindings.el entirely and delete +commands.el.

Fortunately, besides disabled the evil module, that should be all you need to do
to get an evil-less DOOM Emacs.
